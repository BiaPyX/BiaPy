"""
This module implements the Deep Residual Channel Attention Networks (RCAN) model, a prominent architecture for image super-resolution.

RCAN leverages very deep residual networks combined with channel attention
mechanisms to achieve high-quality image reconstruction. The model is built
upon several key components:

Classes:
--------
- ChannelAttention: Implements a channel attention mechanism that recalibrates
  channel-wise feature responses by modeling interdependencies between channels.
- RCAB (Residual Channel Attention Block): A fundamental building block that
  combines residual learning with the ChannelAttention mechanism.
- RG (Residual Group): A collection of multiple RCABs, followed by a
  convolutional layer, with a global residual connection.
- rcan: The main RCAN model, integrating the initial feature extraction,
  multiple Residual Groups, and an optional upscaling module for super-resolution.

The implementation supports both 2D and 3D image inputs and is adapted from
the official RCAN-pytorch repository.
