"""
This module implements the Wide Activation for Efficient and Accurate Image Super-Resolution (WDSR) model.

WDSR is a convolutional neural network designed for single image super-resolution.
It introduces "wide activation" (using a larger number of feature maps in intermediate
layers of residual blocks) and employs weight normalization to stabilize training
and improve performance. The model consists of an initial convolutional layer,
a series of residual blocks, a final reconstruction layer, and a skip connection
with a PixelShuffle layer for upsampling.

Classes:
--------
- wdsr: The main WDSR model.
- Block: The residual block used within the WDSR architecture.
