The last dimension however has a size of >=32, which indicates that you provided a multi-image array with shape (N, H, W) instead. If that is the case, you should use e.g. augmenter(imageS=<your input>) or augment_imageS(<your input>). Otherwise your multi-image input will be interpreted as a single image during augmentation.\n","  ia.warn(\n","\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 30% 3/10 [00:00<00:00, 19.88it/s]\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 50% 5/10 [00:00<00:00, 19.45it/s]\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 80% 8/10 [00:00<00:00, 19.95it/s]\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","                         \u001b[A\n","  0% 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\u001b[A\n","100% 10/10 [00:00<00:00, 19.46it/s]\n","2023-02-09 09:14:05.467807: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_bfc_allocator.cc:42] Overriding orig_value setting because the TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH environment variable is set.

The latter is a metric which shows how well the network performs on a subset of unseen data which is set aside from the training dataset. For more information on this, see for example [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6381354/) by Nichols *et al.*\n","\n","**Training loss** describes an error value after each epoch for the difference between the model's prediction and its ground-truth target.\n","\n","**Validation loss** describes the same error value between the model's prediction on a validation image and compared to it's target.\n","\n","During training both values should decrease before reaching a minimal value which does not decrease further even after more training. Comparing the development of the validation loss with the training loss can give insights into the model's performance.\n","\n","Decreasing **Training loss** and **Validation loss** indicates that training is still necessary and increasing the `number_of_epochs` is recommended. Note that the curves can look flat towards the right side, just because of the y-axis scaling. The network has reached convergence once the curves flatten out. After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased.\n","\n","The **Jaccard index or Intersection over Union** (IoU) metric is a method that can be used to quantify the overlap between the target mask and your prediction output. **Therefore, the closer to 1, the better the performance.** This metric can be used to assess the quality of your model to accurately predict
